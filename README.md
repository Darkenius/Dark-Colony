# Dark-Colony
Old G2 project from 2014-2015.

This ZEN contains full colony mixing in G1 and G2 style. 

There are LOTS of trees and locations improvised with vobs. Also some waypoints in certain areas.

Recommended for use if you want fully exteneded G2 Colony mod or make a Gothic 2 Sequel.

1000 years old Colony after hero's last visit.
Suitable for Gothic 2 Sequel or special G2 mod.
Every possible known location from G1 and G2. Lots of trees, vobs and waypoints in certain areas. I also added locations inspired from Returning mod.

If you use this project, you have to finish waypoint system all over colony and add collectible items.
